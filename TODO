- [X] basic setup
- [X] functionality
  - [X] view different solutions
  - [X] boilerplate
  - [X] style placeholder
  - [X] drag
  - [X] drop
- [-] improve drag target detection
  - [X] find nearest more reliably
  - [X] prevent defaulting to last element
  - [X] drag between lists
    - [X] within same position container
    - [X] between different position containers
    - [X] recalculate centers in containers if dragged over
    - [X] The placeholder can not be placed before the first item
    - [X] on container change, add the placeholder, even if moving sideways
  - [X] handle nested lists
    - [X] ditch center based sorting, because for it to work we need containers of the same size
          Otherwise some containers might have such a big weight, that they pull the placeholder to itself, even if the cursor is over another container
    - [X] dragging an item with child containers searches within itself
    - [X] childGroup should not be recreated after a move
  - [X] set width/height of a dragged item on drag start and remove those values on drop
  - [X] only use left mouse button
  - [X] make sorting work with bootstrap menu
    - [X] add bootstrap menu to html
    - [X] implement vertical detection/option
    - [X] disable child container creation as option
    - [X] don't find invisible child containers (this is the responsibility of the user)
  - [ ] handle margin ?
- [ ] optional sort handle
- [ ] pure drag container
- [ ] pure drop container
- [ ] enable/disable sorting
- [ ] implement scroll on moving to the border of a scroll area
- [ ] save placeholder position to prevent unnecessary DOM interactions
- [ ] calculate item/container dimensions relative to the container => Not all centers have to be recalculated
- [ ] implement float right detection
