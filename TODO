- [X] bug: move last li out of container, back in again, out again => container not droppable
- [ ] use middleman (if rack compatible again)
- [ ] build example page
- [ ] find telling name (bootstrap-sortable)
- [ ] push to github
- [ ] calculate item/container dimensions relative to the container => Not all centers have to be recalculated
- [ ] pure drop container ?
