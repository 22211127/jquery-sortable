- [X] basic setup
- [X] functionality
  - [X] view different solutions
  - [X] boilerplate
  - [X] style placeholder
  - [X] drag
  - [X] drop
- [-] improve drag target detection
  - [X] find nearest more reliably
  - [X] prevent defaulting to last element
  - [X] drag between lists
    - [X] within same position container
    - [X] between different position containers
    - [X] recalculate centers in containers if dragged over
    - [X] The placeholder can not be placed before the first item
    - [X] on container change, add the placeholder, even if moving sideways
  - [ ] handle nested lists
    - [ ] ditch center based sorting, because for it to work we need containers of the same size
          Otherwise some containers might have such a big weight, that they pull the placeholder to itself, even if the cursor is over another container
    - [ ] dragging an item with child containers searches within itself
    - [ ] childGroup should not be recreated after a move
  - [ ] handle margin
- [ ] implement scroll on moving to the border of a scroll area
- [ ] calculate item/container centers relative to the container => Not all centers have to be recalculated
